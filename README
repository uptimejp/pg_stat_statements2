pg_stat_statements2
===================

About
-----

pg_stat_statements2 is a pg_stat_statement-derivative from PostgreSQL
9.4.4.

This module has two modifications from the original pg_stat_statements
to work with the sql_firewall extension at the same time.

 1. Name of the extension has been changed to 'pg_stat_statements2' to
    resolve the name conflict even if you already have
    pg_stat_statements.

 2. Query Id is calculated using relation names instead of relation
    ids which is done by the original pg_stat_statements. So, Query Id
    can keep the same value even if the table get re-created (drop &
    create).
