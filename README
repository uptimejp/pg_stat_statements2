pg_stat_statements2
===================

About
-----

pg_stat_statements2 is a pg_stat_statement-derivative from PostgreSQL
9.4.4.

This module has two modifications from the original pg_stat_statements
to work with the sql_firewall extension at the same time.

 1. Name of the extension has been changed to 'pg_stat_statements2' to
    resolve the name conflict even if you already have
    pg_stat_statements.

 2. JumbleQuery() function is removed from this module, and
    pgss_post_parse_analyze() calls JumbleQuery() in the sql_firewall
    module (shared library).

    So, this module must be used with the sql_firewall module, and it
    needs to be loaded prior to the pg_stat_statements2 as following:

      shared_preload_libraries = 'sql_firewall,pg_stat_statements2'
